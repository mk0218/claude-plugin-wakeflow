<!-- Shared rule (SSOT): re-resolve task-doc paths when in a linked worktree. Subcommands inject this
     via !`cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/worktree.md` at entry. -->

**Worktree rule** — task/issue/archive docs (`.claude/local/`'s `tasks/`·`issues/`·`archive/`) exist
**only in the main worktree**. A linked worktree (created via `git worktree add`) is usually branched
off a ref that predates these docs, so its own copy is stale or absent. Therefore, when the current
working directory is a linked worktree, re-resolve `<project-root>` to the **main worktree** (the first
entry of `git worktree list`) and read/write under that `.claude/local/` — never the linked worktree's
own path.

- Read-side (`list`·`update`·`todo`): re-resolve **before** locating the task. Otherwise you read the
  linked worktree's empty `tasks/` and wrongly report "no in-progress task".
- Write-side (`start`·`tidy`·`end`): re-resolve **immediately before** creating/moving files.

This rule applies even when a subcommand is invoked directly (`/task:update`, etc.) — every subcommand
is its own entry point.
